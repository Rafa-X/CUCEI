## Docker Basic App
The goal with this app is to underteand the elemental way to work with docker and apps. Creates the containers and the images using a **docker-compose** file, then displays a series of random data created with the module "Faker". <br>

This random data is from the Faker method .profile(), gets **n** characteristics that a persons profile can contain.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no need to install manually the required modules, the **Dockerfile** already does when the image is created. You can see them in the file **requirements.txt**.

+ To create the container and the image of the project just run the **docker-compose** file:
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;">
  <img width="400"  src="images/command1.png" align="center">
</p>
